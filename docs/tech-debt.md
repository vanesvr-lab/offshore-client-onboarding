# Tech Debt Log

Items deferred during brief work — small fixes / cleanups that didn't justify a
dedicated brief but shouldn't be lost. Each entry: date added, brief that spawned
it, one-line description, and a brief note on why it was deferred.

Newest items at the top. Strike-through (`~~…~~`) when resolved, then optionally
remove after 30 days.

- **Admin routes don't set `app.actor_*` session config before mutations.**
  *Spawned by:* [B-094](cli-brief-audit-actor-name-b094.md).
  *What:* Add a small `setActorContext(supabase, session)` helper and call it at the top of every admin API route that uses `createAdminClient()` and performs a mutation that may fire a DB-side audit trigger. Today no service-table trigger writes audit_log, so the hardened `get_actor_info()` from this brief is purely defensive — but if a future migration adds a status-change trigger on `services` (or similar), admin routes will need to push the actor identity into the session config or those audits will revert to `'system'`.
  *Why deferred:* Currently unused — the app-layer `writeAuditLog` fix covers the symptom Vanessa observed. The session-config plumbing is a future-proofing layer; deferred to keep B-094 small.

- **Denormalise status-change actor + timestamp onto `services`.**
  *Spawned by:* [B-093](cli-brief-status-card-redesign-b093.md).
  *What:* Add `status_changed_at TIMESTAMPTZ` and `status_changed_by UUID` columns to `services`, populate via the existing audit trigger (or a new one) on every status update. Read these in `page.tsx` instead of running a separate `audit_log` query for the right-rail Status card.
  *Why deferred:* B-093 ships with an audit-log query — works, just one extra query per page render. Migration + trigger update is a separate change to keep B-093 small.
